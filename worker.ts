/**
 * Standalone BullMQ Worker Process

 * This file runs as a separate process/container dedicated to processing background jobs.
 * Separating workers from the web server allows independent scaling and better resource isolation.

 * Usage:
 *   - Development: bun run workers:dev
 *   - Production: bun run workers:start
